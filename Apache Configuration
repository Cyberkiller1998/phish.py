Configure Apache to run Python CGI

1. Open the "httpd.conf" apache configuration file located in the apache install directory in the conf directory. 

2. Search the "httpd.conf" file for the line:

        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

3. Add ExecCGI to this line. The line should now look similar to the following (NOTE: there may be more options listed):

        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI

4. Next, search for the following:

        #AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

5. Uncomment this line by removing the "#" in front of the line, and add a .py to the end of the line.
   The new line should look like this:

        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py
        
3. Restart Apache
